An alternate method for generating
Characteristic scores is to give each player a
number of Characteristic points that he may assign as
he wishes. In this case, the player begins with a score
of 25 in each Characteristic and may allocate a total of
100 additional points to his Characteristics, adding no
more than 20 to any one Characteristic. This method
will generate characters with slightly higher than
average scores.
